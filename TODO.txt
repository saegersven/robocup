TODO:
- implement timeout for single_distance() and distance_avg()
- "speedboost" on ramps
- improve accuracy when detecting silver (include front distance sensor, make sure there are no black contours, check side distance)
- NN for intersections
- global variable for movement on/off which is changed whenever the button on the robot is pressed
- calibration scripts (silver, ...)
- timout when waiting for gyroscope heading, entering "savetymode" after timout
