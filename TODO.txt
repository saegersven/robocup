Important TODOs:
- rewrite find_black_corner()
- rewrite find_exit()
- detect and collect rescuekit
- detect red stripe 
- implement proper silver detection
- distinguish between living and dead victims
- "speedboost" on ramps (check gyroscope in seperate thread)



- improve accuracy when detecting silver (include front distance sensor, make sure there are no black contours, check side distance) maybe even NN
- NN for intersections
- global variable for movement on/off which is changed whenever the button on the robot is pressed
- calibration scripts (silver, ...)
- timout when waiting for gyroscope heading, entering "savetymode" after timout 
- savetymode for detecting silver
- intersection redundancy using additional NN
